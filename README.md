### Ongoing Research Projects:

[Safe Agricultural Products and Water Graph (SAWGraph)](https://sawgraph.github.io/) An Open Knowledge Network to Monitor and Trace PFAS and Other Contaminants in the Nation's Food and Water Systems (funded by NSF as part of the Proto-OKN initiative]

[Digital Forest Knowledge Graph](https://github.com/theSKAILab/DigitalForestKG)  

[A Cellulose Informatics System (CelloGraph)](https://github.com/theSKAILab/CelloGraph)

[Macleod: A Common Logic (LC) environment for ontology development](https://github.com/thahmann/macleod)
A set of tools for the verification of first-order ontologies expressed using Common Logic. It uses a modular and parallel approach to verification, utilizing existing theorem provers and model finders in parallel to find inconsistencies in ontologies or to prove their consistency by finding a model. The modular approach helps to localize problems or identify consistent subtheories. This tool set also serves as a testbed for various heuristics for module selection in the verification process. The tools are set up to interface directly with COLORE.

### Ontologies:

[Ontology for Named Entity Representation (OnNER)](https://github.com/theSKAILab/OnNER/blob/main/ontology/onner-1.0.ttl) OnNER is intended to represent terms or named entities where and how they appear in scientific publications. It can capture the structure and text content of publications and any named entities detected therein - as extracted by various NER tools - as an RDF document to be loaded into a Knowledge Graph. These documents can be easily queried together for their named entities. The ontology is developed as part of the CelloGraph project.

[The Spatial and Temporal Aggregate Data (STAD) Ontology Design Pattern](https://theskailab.github.io/STAD/stad.html) A pattern to represent statistically aggregated datapoints, with a focus on data that has been spatially, temporally or spatio-temporally aggregated. 

[The Contaminant Observations and Samples Ontology (ContaminOSO)](https://github.com/SAWGraph/contaminoso) ContaminOSO models observations of contaminants in the environment. These are primarily sampled observations, such as from water or soil samples, but also include observations of releases of contaminants into the environment, such as annual release reports of facilities that are mandated for reporting to EPA by the Clean Water and Clean Air Acts.
