# theSKAILab.github.io: Spatial Knowledge and AI (SKAI) Lab

## Future home of the SKAI Lab, where all ontologies, publications and other materials will be hosted.

Ontologies hosted here:

The [Ontology for Named Entity Representation (OnNER)](https://github.com/theSKAILab/OnNER/blob/main/ontology/onner-1.0.ttl) models named entities as they appear in scientific publications and what is necessary to locate them therein. It is intended to be used to capture each publication and all its named entities - as extracted by various NER tools - as an RDF document. These documents can be easily queried together for their named entities.
